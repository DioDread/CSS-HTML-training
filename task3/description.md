# Task 3

This task is a combination of previous two, it will require straight markup skills with some UX design included. You need
to implement few pages of your upcoming graduation task (spoiler! <img src="http://smileys.on-my-web.com/repository/Happy/happy-020.gif"></img>)

One main page, which you need to create with existing mockup, and few small pages which you need to create in a same style as main page, but decoration layout, positioning, paddings, sizing, etc. you free to choose on your taste. But remember 1st task, and don't overdo. This task will be provided in 3 variants, group list split by variants see below. **Adaptiveness and Responsiveness** is advanced part for you, so if you want to get higher mark, you must to do it, and top mark w/o adaptive layout for this task is 8, but it's more than enough to get good feedback, but can your ambitions bear with this?

This pages is a part of e-Shop application which we will implement as your graduation task, so if you need inspiration you can find many templates or existing shops on the Internet.

## Pages
1. Main page, create it from mockup which can be found here(take your variant this is __IMPORTANT__): [Variant \#1](#), [Variant \#2](#), [Variant \#3](#).
2. Login page, simple login form with two inputs(but who will knew which?) and one checkbox (Remember Me), and one button - Login. No header or footer allowed, this page will be open in popup, after user clicks on Login button, which you need to add to main page layout somehow ;)
3. Registration page, looks pretty similar to your second task (no copy please!), but no need to add all set of controls, because this will be clarified as soon as you will get clear requirements about __User__ entity from your Java trainers. So limit it with _Last Name, First Name, Address, Email Password, Confirm Password and Tel_, but in more logical order. Still No headers and footers!
4. User profile page. Page which is used to display user data, and Photo if loaded, in case if not loaded - show some nice placeholder. To be honest, all pages will be embed in main page, so there is no needs in header and footer except 1st one. And again, fields must be displayed only for demo purposes, which fields to show exactly, will be described later.
5. Shopping cart __Widget__, small page which will be represent customers shopping cart, which, I advice, contains table with some short list of ready to purchase products. Widget total size must be not more than 1/5 of page size.
6. Product detail page, pretty the same as User Profile page, but with product  <img src="http://smileys.on-my-web.com/repository/Happy/happy-020.gif"></img>, include product info, some textual description, picture (same way as User Info), maybe some ratings stars, etc. It's all depends on you, but not create poor design.

## Nota Bene
All this markups need to be created with hardcoded data, hardcoded texts, pictures, prices, User Info, etc. No needs to create any hyperlinks, pages will be served by JS. All this data will be replaced by template values which you will obtain from backends, but for demo purposes please fill all pages enough. You free to ask me about your UX Design decisions, but remember, what I am not always free to answer, so excuse me in advance please!
