# Task 1

This task include typography, basic styling, box model, and layout creation related work.

## Description

Create simple web document. Which include text and images which is placed within 3 provided mockups.
Mockups not a final design, you must not reproduce it completely. So just follow page structure from mockup and choose colors, backgrounds and fonts whatever you want. But not overdo.

__1st page__, represents famous concept - 'Landing page' combine textual and graphic information. Available for scrolling. Contains few logically complete parts separate at blocks.

__2nd page__, just a simple 'wiki' page. With text and pictures.

__3d page__, represents 'data-reporting' page. With some structured data displayed within (table)

Links on 2nd and 3d page place at first page, anywhere you want, but not make it like stupid underlined Page 1, Page 2 and so on. Feel free to experiment.

Use following markups to develop your pages:

### Design
* <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioDread/CSS-HTML-training/master/task1/design/Page%201.png" target="_blank">Page 1</a>
* <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioDread/CSS-HTML-training/master/task1/design/Page%202.png" target="_blank">Page 2</a>
* <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DioDread/CSS-HTML-training/master/task1/design/Page%203.png" target="_blank">Page 3</a>

### Requirements.
  In most cases this more creativity then technical task, but this is not excuse for bad performance. I mean for those who come with ugly pages and will say what they are "back-end developers", I have special "back-end only treatment" hope you not one of them. Markup is tightly related to design. But feel of space and style is important in any cases, as soon as you provide poor design of your future business apps front-end for your customers you will get poor feedback on your overall work, because at 1st - nobody there will see your "super-cool back-end code", 2nd - all will see your ugly front-end =).
