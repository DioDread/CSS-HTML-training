# Task 2

This task is straight and simple, it's not about your fantasy and design skills but about your html CSS usage knowledge
and skills.
All what you need is to implement registration page as it show at design picture. All elements must look and feel same as
it displayed. They must share same design. Ideally all your task solutions must look the same. Use provided header background photo, all in tasks _design_ folder.

## Requirements
- Using of CSS frameworks and libs prohibited, and now if I will found one, that will lead to task automatic fail
(didn't complain than, and remove all your normalizers please).
- Using of JS also will lead to punishment, only in case if you can prove me what something impossible w/o using it I can tolerate.
- Design violations is strongly prohibited.
- You need to create form "as is", no adaptive or relative markups required.
- Fonts, paddings, color all must look how it show on mockup, in case if I find differences in your form and design, it will affect your mark.

## Due date
All forms must be sent to me not less than 8/3/2016

Good luck!
